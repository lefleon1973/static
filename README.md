Solve static frame by inputing .sta file 
.sta files are self explained and provide all details to the frame.
The solution of equations is achieved by solving symmetric sparse linear system using
a variation of Crout method. In order to optimize the system Mc-kee algorithm was used to have coefficients near the diagonal.
